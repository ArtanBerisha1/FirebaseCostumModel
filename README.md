# Digit Classifier Android sample
-This is part of the Google Codelabs example "Add Firebase to your TFLite-powered Android App" (https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/digitclassifier-android?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fcodelabs.developers.google.com%2F%3Fauthuser%3D1#0)

I created my Firebase Console and new project with it according to the codelab steps, one thing that I missed and was confusing was to check the name of the model that I was uploading to Firebase with the name that was passed as parameter to downloadModel() method.
